AStar-Haskell
===============

An A* implementation in Haskell.

This project is essentially a clean-up Haskell port of [this Scala implementation of mine](https://github.com/TheBizzle/PathFinding).  Currently, I'm only planning on implementing unidirectional A\*, but bidirectional A\* might be implemented later.
